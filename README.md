# Predictive Maintenance Model

This repository contains a Industrial Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Model that uses machine learning to predict equipment failures before they occur. 

## Features
- Machine learning-based failure prediction
- Edge AI support (optimized for deployment on IoT devices)
- Data preprocessing using `ColumnTransformer`
- Supports multiple sensor data sources
